# UFOs

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to develop a webpage for people to view the UFO sighting data provided by the client. Several filters were added so that the visitor can filter the sightings by the following criteria:
- Date of sighting
- City where UFO was seen
- State where UFO was seen
- Country where UFO was seen
- Shape of UFO

The webpage can be viewed at https://sedaverde.github.io/UFOs/.

## How to Use the Webpage
On the right side of the page there is a column titled Filter.

The visitor types in their search criteria into at least on of the available boxes. After pressing enter, the app will loop through the listings and only display those that match the search criteria. If no listings match the search criteria, then the page will turn blank.

Eg. The below image demonstrates the listings returned when the city of Fresno is entered as the search criteria.

## Improvements
The current filter design has one major drawback; the default entries designed to serve as an example for users cannot be easily distinguished from criteria that is manually entered by the visitor. Different styling of the text, or removal of the examples is recommended. Additionally, updating the dataset to be more comprehensive is also recommended.
